# list-post-snippets-by-category-shortcode
Description: List post snippets by category shortcode plugin lists all your posts from selected category you specify in the shortcode category attribute. lists a little excerpt of everything including a thumbnail, title, excerpt, and a read more tag.

This is the shortcode [posts-by-cat]. adding it as it, won't work unless you fill the attributes. one neccessary attribute is "category", where you type your category name and NOT SLUG, for instance, "uncategorized" or, "main category".
To add a custom thumbnail to use in case your post(s) don't have a thumbnail associated, fill the image URL in the "thumbnail" shortcode attribue.

An example use:

[posts-by-cat category="uncategorized" thumbnail="http://s.elegance-style.com/dv/i/thumb.jpg"]
